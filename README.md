## A 2 million year climate simulation reveals an opposing relationship between IOD and ENSO

This repository contains the analysis notebooks used for the paper **“A 2 million year climate simulation reveals an opposing relationship between IOD and ENSO”**.

### Notebooks

- `1_IOD_ENSO_PC_analysis.ipynb`  
  Principal component analysis and related diagnostics for IOD/ENSO.

- `2_IOD_ENSO_mean_std.ipynb`  
  Mean and standard-deviation analysis of IOD/ENSO-related indices and fields.

- `3_IOD_ENSO_composites.ipynb`  
  Composite analyses for different IOD/ENSO phases and configurations.

- `4_IOD_ENSO_szn_cycle.ipynb`  
  Seasonal cycle analysis and related diagnostics for IOD/ENSO.

The notebooks are designed to be run with the environment described in `requirements_3.11.11.txt` from the original local project.
